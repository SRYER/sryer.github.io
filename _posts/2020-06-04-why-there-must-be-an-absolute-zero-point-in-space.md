NOTE: This post is all wrong. I got the answer from a stackexchange-site and posted the update in the end of this post.

I have been thinking about a subject a couple of times, latest at lunch at work today - Is all movement in space relative or is there an absolute point where things do simply NOT move?

My theory:

```
There MUST be an absolute zero point - but not necessarily easy (nor possible) to measure.
```

### Einstein said...

To explain why I think this must be true, I would like to list two statements that the public seems to agree on and of which I think are contradictory:

> 1. The faster you move, the slower does time feel
> 2. There is no absolute zero point of speed - all movement is relative ([Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillianscudder/2016/04/16/astroquizzical-zero-point-speeds/#36fb68382a3c))

Statement 1 is discussed here: [Time travels](https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html#:~:text=Einstein's%20theory%20of%20special%20relativity,relativity%2C%20gravity%20can%20bend%20time.)

The article states:

> "...physicist Albert Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative â€” it can vary for different observers depending on your speed through space."

So, this means: If two persons move at different speeds, the fastest moving person will observe time as passing by slower than the other person. Actually, the very atoms that the person consists of will move around slower in relation to each other which will cause this "feel" of slowing time in the human brain.

### Get to the point, Stephan

Okay okay. So say we remove all other objects in the world so we have a universe with just these two persons. If all movement is relative, there would have been no notion of different speeds of movements of the two persons. So there MUST be an absolute definition of zero movement in the universe for statement 1. to be true.

### Measuring the point zero

So, how do we measure this? I really don't know. Maybe we will never be able to. Maybe knowing what the asbolute zero is will never be important as everything we can achieve can be done without ever knowing this. But it must exist.

... It must.

### What am I missing?

I am fully aware that lots of people actually work and study this area quite intensively. So, I would expect that an expert on this subject may be able to pin point what I might be missing. So this is my invite to join the discussion in the thread below.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts in the matter.

### UPDATE: I was wrong

I copy pasted this blog entry as a post [here](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/36432/absolute-zero-speed-in-space), and a kind person was pointing out, that in fact that statement 1. is wrong: The "feeling" of time, or should one say, the observation of time, is relative to the observer. This means that both persons will observe that the other persons time passes slower.

Apparently, this is what the [Twin paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20the%20twin%20paradox,on%20Earth%20has%20aged%20more.) is all about.
